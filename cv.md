### About me

I have been interested in programming since of 2020. In the end of that year I decided to start my studies in this sphere. At first I had taken several paid courses in my city, after that I preferred to study by myself. Unfortunately I did not have opportunity to devote enough time to my self education, so because of it programming was like a favorite hobby for me.
Now I have prioritized and finnaly put web development at first place. Today I spend all my time on self education, place enormous emphasis on English and also I am ready to spend as much time on my future career as it needed.
